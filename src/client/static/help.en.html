					<h1>What is StruViMan?</h1>
				</template>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>A growing number of manuscripts are available digitally online. This offers new opportunities for scholars to engage with manuscripts and their contents. Since ancient codices are complex objects and their current state is often the result of several layers of production, it is useful to explore their dimensions in a way that goes beyond image and text. Differences in production units, material support, quires and scribes (to name but a few) can all provide insight into the development of the codex as an evolving object over time.</p>

					<p>The Structural Visualization of Manuscripts (StruViMan) is a web service that was created as a practical extension of the <a href="https://www.ptb.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/" target="_blank">Paratexts of the Greek Bible Project</a>, an ERC project based at the LMU in Munich. Using mainly digital reproductions (such as those available through the <a href="http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/" target="_blank">NTVMR</a> at University Μünster), the team carefully reviews each New Testament manuscript and the presence of biblical texts and paratexts is documented in a database.</p>

					<p>StruViMan takes these manuscript data and transforms them into a visual representation that reveals a manuscript’s structure at a glance. The visualization provides information related both to the codex’s chronological development (here in the form of the different production units) and to the structural aspects of its contents (in this model, these are arranged by category). Further information is accessed easily by clicking on the relevant parts of the visualization.</p>
					
					<p>The visualization is currently accessible via three variants:
						<ul>
							<li>On the results page of a manuscript on the website <a href="https://www.ptb.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/" target="_blank">Paratexts of the Greek Bible</a> under the item <b>Visualization of this manuscript</b>.</li>
							<li>On the results page of a manuscript on the website <a href="https://pinakes-dev.irht.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">Pinakes </a>top left under the item <b>Visualiseur</b>.</li>
							<li>Click directly here on the <a href="https://www.struviman-test.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/" target="_blank">StruViMan website</a> on the small graphic in the upper right corner. There you will find a few selected manuscripts.</li>
						<ul>

					<h1>Technical Concept</h1>
				</template>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>The StruViMan web service is on the one hand connected to the <a href="https://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">Pinakes project</a> and on the other hand to the <a href="https://www.ptb.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/" target="_blank">PtB project</a>. Both projects use the same database, but sometimes show different aspects of a handwriting.</p>
					
					<p>The <a href="https://www.ptb.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/" target="_blank">PtB project</a> is currently under construction. After entering a dictyon number, selected details of the respective handwriting are displayed (<a href="https://www.ptb.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/de/manuscript/?cote=55612" target="_blank">example</a>). There you will find the link to the visualization of the handwriting:</p>
					
					<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/help/visualization.png" alt="PtB Link"></p>					

					<p>On the <a href="https://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">Pinakes website</a> users have also the opportunity to view detailed manuscript data. On <a href="https://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">Pinakes</a> page associated with a particular manuscript there are several options in the upper right corner:</p>

					<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/help/pinakes.png" alt="Pinakes Link"></p>

					<p>By clicking on the "Visualiseur" option, users will be redirected to the StruViMan web service in a new tab in the same browser window, analogously also for the PtB project. The two tabs are linked to a SessionID. Further manuscripts are thus also displayed in the currently open StruViMan tab. If several StruViMan tabs or windows are open, they will all appear the same (or, at the latest, after refreshing the page).</p>

					<p>The implementation of StruViMan was based on the latest web programming standards: Vue.js, a JavaScript web framework, HTML5 and CSS3. The visualization of StruViMan is a vector graphic (SVG).</p>

					<p>The data from the database is stored in an XML file using PHP and an XML schema (XSD) and sent to our server via JSON (server platform: Node.js).</p>

					<p>The server-side component is necessary because it is not hosted on the same server as the database from <a href="https://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">Pinakes</a> and <a href="https://www.ptb.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/" target="_blank">PtB</a> and it is therefore easier for the Struviman server to collect and parse the XMLdata from the database before forwarding it to the browser. As such, it can also be easily extended to interact with other systems or servers to provide similar visualization functionality. If you are interested, please get in touch with one of the contact persons (information available in the bar at the bottom of the screen).</p>

					<p>In the future it is also planned to make the software publicly available as open source.</p>

					<p>The visualization represents the view of a book on its side.</p>

					<p><img src="images/help/design-concept-en.png" alt="Design Concept"></p>

						<p><b>Production units:</b> the spine of the book in this example consists of a bar divided into two differently-colored sections. It shows how many production units are present in the manuscript and at what point in the manuscript they occur.</p>
						
						<p><b>Pieces of content:</b> the pages of the book not only give an overview of the pieces of content inside the codex, but also show how much space each item occupies. The colors show which pieces of content are part of the same category. It is also easy to see which sections of the book belong to the same production unit.</p>
						
						<p>Different production units are distinguished by their different <b>colors</b>. The same color, on the other hand, is assigned to content elements which belong to the same category. For example, the content elements belonging to the category Imagines all receive the color black. The color schemes of production units and content elements never overlap. In Advanced Mode all colors can be individually adjusted.

						StruViMan is designed to be both intuitive and easy to operate for a beginner. Moreover, Easy Mode can provide fast and simple access to the visualizations of various manuscripts without requiring the user to change any settings.<br>

					<p>The extended number of options and a greater degree of customizability in the display is what Advanced Mode has to offer users wishing to have greater control over individual aspects of their manuscript visualizations.

							<p>The manuscript window has a fixed size in Easy Mode and, as such, the window size cannot be altered. Even manuscripts with a large amount of content elements are initially displayed in this standard size.

						<p>If the user hovers over a content element in the visualization, a pop-up containing the relevant information will appear. A click on an individual element within the graphic causes information from the database relevant to that element to be displayed in the information area below. Clicking on any of the white spaces in the manuscript window results in the
						display of select information relating to the manuscript as a whole in the information area. </p>
